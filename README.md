# FlyingPizzaTelloAdapter
An adapter made for TelloSDK drones to connect to FlyingPizza Fleet Management

Note: Tello Drones being WIFI with its autoleveling being light-based make this objectively bad for actual deliveries
      Tello Drones also don't have location data, so approximation is calculated which is often off by 0.2 meters or greater
